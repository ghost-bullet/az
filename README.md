#### Description:
Application android for tracking device, build from scratch and using langauage java also this project allow intergration another project as ex: delivery restaurants.
Using OOP methodlogoy in development app , using functions it's very useful for user and as advntage for UX.System may also detect low battery, real-time GPS tracking.

- background service:
tracking device real time via running service in background also if closed app it's running and tracking location every time.
draw path if move device if driving vehicle or any status and very precise coding draw on the map with marker is image not marker icon.
Processing data in the background is an important part of creating an Android application that is both responsive for your users as well as a good citizen on the Android platform. Doing work on the main thread can lead to poor performance and therefore a poor user experience.

This guide explains what qualifies as background work, defines background task categories, provides you with criteria to categorize your tasks, and recommends APIs that you should use to execute them.

- user location:
My application for users take their devices with them everywhere, and adding location awareness to your app offers users a more contextual experience. Location awareness to your app with automated location tracking, wrong-side-of-the-street detection, geofencing, and activity recognition.

My application well when you request location permissions, follow the same best practices as you would for any other runtime permission. One important difference when it comes to location permissions is that the system includes multiple permissions related to location. Which permissions you request, and how you request them, depend on the location requirements for your app's use case.
